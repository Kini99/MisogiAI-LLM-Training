# Summary of the Reward Modeling Project

## Project Overview

*Briefly describe the goal of this project, which was to train a reward model to distinguish between good and bad answers generated by a language model.*

## Prompts Used

*List the 5 prompts you used for generating answers.*

1.  `Tell me a joke about a programmer.`
2.  `Summarize the plot of the movie Inception in one paragraph.`
3.  `Write a mini-essay on the importance of recycling.`
4.  `What is the difference between a fruit and a vegetable?`
5.  `Explain the concept of machine learning to a 5-year-old.`

## Manual Ranking Observations

*Describe your experience with ranking the answers. Were there clear winners and losers? Were some answers difficult to rank?*

## Evaluation Results

*After training the reward model and running the evaluation in `analyse.ipynb`, paste the final plot here. Describe the results shown in the plot. Does the reward model successfully assign higher scores to better-ranked answers?*

**(Paste your plot here)**

## Conclusion

*Summarize your findings. Was the reward model training successful? What are the potential applications of this model? What could be the next steps for improvement?*
